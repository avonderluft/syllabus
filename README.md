This is the center of the material we will be going over. You should bookmark
this repository, because you are going to be coming here a lot.

## Why GitHub?
Software developers use GitHub all the time in their work. You will be learning
a necessary skill by using it to learn how to code.

## Course Requirements
Please set up the following before the first class.

* A basic laptop. Windows is fine. Students who need to buy a new laptop could
  consider a [ChromeBook][chromebook] as well.
* An email address. We are going to need to communicate. 
* A [GitHub][github] account. We are going to use this, **a lot.**
* A [Nitrous.io][nitrous] account. This is what we are going to use to program with,
  so that everyone will be using the same thing. Use the "sign up with Github"
  link, so you don't have to remember two logins.
* A [CodeSchool][codeschool] account. Also use your GitHub account to sign in
  here.

## Costs
* $25/mo [CodeSchool][codeschool] subscription fee. (Required)
* $5/mo per student to cover costs. ($30)
