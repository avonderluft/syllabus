Lesson 2
========
**Before:** Teach the students the basics of how the internet works. Maybe show
a video and put on a louder sound so that everyone can hear what is being said.
Introduce HTML and CSS as the "language" that is spoken over the web.

The goal of these assignments is to teach you the basics of HTML.

**HTML**: A subset of XML, a way of displaying data on the web. The web page you
are reading this on is made with HTML. This Markdown document compiles down to
HTML. Here's a sample of what an HTML document looks like:

```html
<html>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text with some <strong>bold words</strong> in
it.</p>
</html>
```

**CSS**: The way to add styling to your HTML documents. Here's a sample of CSS:

```css
// Styles the paragraph to be dark grey and 14px font size.
p {
  color: darkgrey,
  font-size: 14px;
}

// Makes the <strong> text bold.
strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
