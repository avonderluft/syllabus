Lesson 2
========
The goal of these assignments is to teach you the basics of HTML and CSS.

**HTML**: A subset of XML, used to displaying interfaces on the web. The web 
page you are reading this on is made with HTML. This Markdown document compiles
down to HTML. Here's a sample of what an HTML document looks like:

```html
<html>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text with some <strong>bold words</strong> in
it.</p>
</html>
```

**CSS**: The way to add styling to your HTML documents. Here's a sample of CSS:

```css
// Styles the paragraph to be dark grey and 14px font size.
p {
  color: darkgrey,
  font-size: 14px;
}

// Makes the <strong> text bold.
strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Assignment Beta
Due Wednesday, April 30

This week, you're going to make a website! I've set up a starter project which
will help you get going: [berkompasacademy/static_template](http://github.com/berkompasacademy/static_template).

1. Fork the **static_template** to make your project.
2. Edit the `index.html` file, and make any website you want. It just needs to
be turned in by the assignment deadline. There might be a prize for the person
who does the best job. 
3. Submit a pull request back to the **static_template** repository with your
work for review.
