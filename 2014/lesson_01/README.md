Lesson 1
===========================================

Welcome to your first assignment! We are going to be following an unusual course
to learn programming: first, we're going to learn our tools. You're going to
learn how to use Git and Github in this lesson today.

## Assignment 1
**Due**: Thursday, April 10

1. Take the [Try Git](http://try.github.io) course.
2. Take the [Git Real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real) course.
3. (Optional) Take [Git Real 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real-2).

## Assignment 2
**Due**: Wednesday, April 16

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your forked repository down to your Nitrous.io box.
3. Start a **new branch** for your changes on your nitrous box.
4. Add your name to the list of students in `/2014/ROSTER.md`.
5. Push your branch to Github.
6. Open a pull request back to this repository.
7. Add a remote called `upstream` to your repo on Nitrous, pointing back to the
original version of this syllabus hosted at `berkompasacademy/syllabus`. This
will allow you to pull in fresh assignments using `git fetch upstream`.

Please ask any questions you have about this assignment in the forum. Especially
if you need help understanding what is going on, even though you figured out how
to do it.
